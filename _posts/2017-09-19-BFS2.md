# Catch That Cow 
## Description
Farmer John has been informed of the location of a fugitive cow and wants to catch her immediately. He starts at a point N (0 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) on a number line and the cow is at a point K (0 ≤ K ≤ 100,000) on the same number line. Farmer John has two modes of transportation: walking and teleporting.

* Walking: FJ can move from any point X to the points X - 1 or X + 1 in a single minute
* Teleporting: FJ can move from any point X to the point 2 × X in a single minute.

If the cow, unaware of its pursuit, does not move at all, how long does it take for Farmer John to retrieve it?

### Input
Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K
### Output
Line 1: The least amount of time, in minutes, it takes for Farmer John to catch the fugitive cow.
### Sample Input
5 17  
### Sample Output
4  
### Hint
The fastest way for Farmer John to reach the fugitive cow is to move along the following path: 5-10-9-18-17, which takes 4 minutes.

            vis[nex.x] = true;
            q.push(nex);
        }

    scanf("%d%d", &n, &k);
    memset(vis, false, sizeof(vis));
    vis[n] = true;
    BFS();

    return 0;

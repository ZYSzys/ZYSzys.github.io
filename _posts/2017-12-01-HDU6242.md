## Problem Description
Alice is interesting in computation geometry problem recently. She found a interesting problem and solved it easily. Now she will give this problem to you :

You are given N distinct points (Xi,Yi) on the two-dimensional plane. Your task is to find a point P and a real number R, such that for at least ⌈N2⌉ given points, their distance to point P is equal to R.
 

### Input
The first line is the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains one positive number N(1≤N≤105).

The following N lines describe the points. Each line contains two real numbers Xi and Yi (0≤|Xi|,|Yi|≤103) indicating one give point. It's guaranteed that N points are distinct.
 

### Output
For each test case, output a single line with three real numbers XP,YP,R, where (XP,YP) is the coordinate of required point P. Three real numbers you output should satisfy 0≤|XP|,|YP|,R≤109.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one solution satisfying all conditions. And if there are different solutions, print any one of them. The judge will regard two point's distance as R if it is within an absolute error of 10−3 of R.
 

### Sample Input
```
1
7
1 1
1 0
1 -1
0 1
-1 1
0 -1
-1 0
```
 

### Sample Output
```
0 0 1
```

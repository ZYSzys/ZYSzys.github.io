## Problem Description
Jesus, what a great movie! Thousands of people are rushing to the cinema. However, this is really a tuff time for Joe who sells the film tickets. He is wandering when could he go back home as early as possible.
A good approach, reducing the total time of tickets selling, is let adjacent people buy tickets together. As the restriction of the Ticket Seller Machine, Joe can sell a single ticket or two adjacent tickets at a time.
Since you are the great JESUS, you know exactly how much time needed for every person to buy a single ticket or two tickets for him/her. Could you so kind to tell poor Joe at what time could he go back home as early as possible? If so, I guess Joe would full of appreciation for your help.
 

### Input
There are N(1<=N<=10) different scenarios, each scenario consists of 3 lines:
1) An integer K(1<=K<=2000) representing the total number of people;
2) K integer numbers(0s<=Si<=25s) representing the time consumed to buy a ticket for each person;
3) (K-1) integer numbers(0s<=Di<=50s) representing the time needed for two adjacent people to buy two tickets together.
 

### Output
For every scenario, please tell Joe at what time could he go back home as early as possible. Every day Joe started his work at 08:00:00 am. The format of time is HH:MM:SS am|pm.
 

### Sample Input
2  
2  
20 25  
40  
1  
8
 

### Sample Output
08:00:40 am  
08:00:08 am  

## 代码：
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int N = 2010;
int dp[N], a[N], b[N];
int main()
{
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);
    while(t--)
    {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
        memset(a, 0, sizeof(a));
        memset(b, 0, sizeof(b));
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        }
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        {
            scanf("%d", &b[i]);//b[i]表示第i-1个人和第i个人一起买所花费的时间
        }
        dp[1] = a[1];
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1]+a[i], dp[i-2]+b[i]);
            //前两个人分开买或者一起买所花费的最少时间
        }
        int s = dp[n]%60, m = dp[n]/60;
        int h = m/60 + 8;
        m %= 60;
        printf("%.2d:%.2d:%.2d %s\n", h%12, m, s, (h/12) ? "pm":"am");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

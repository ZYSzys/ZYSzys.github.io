[HDU 1780 Doing Homework again](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/showproblem.php?pid=1789)

贪心思想，按照得分从大到小排序，然后从没门作业的截止日期往前扫，保证得分高的作业完成，扫到0都无法完成的那么就失分

## Problem Description
Ignatius has just come back school from the 30th ACM/ICPC. Now he has a lot of homework to do. Every teacher gives him a deadline of handing in the homework. If Ignatius hands in the homework after the deadline, the teacher will reduce his score of the final test. And now we assume that doing everyone homework always takes one day. So Ignatius wants you to help him to arrange the order of doing homework to minimize the reduced score.
 

### Input
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T that is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
Each test case start with a positive integer N(1<=N<=1000) which indicate the number of homework.. Then 2 lines follow. The first line contains N integers that indicate the deadlines of the subjects, and the next line contains N integers that indicate the reduced scores.
 

### Output
For each test case, you should output the smallest total reduced score, one line per test case.
 

### Sample Input
3  
3  
3 3 3  
10 5 1  
3  
1 3 1  
6 2 3  
7  
1 4 6 4 2 4 3  
3 2 1 7 6 5 4  
 

### Sample Output
0  
3  
5
 

## 代码：
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1010;
struct Hw
{
	int time, score;
}a[N];
bool used[N];//记录作业完成与否
bool cmp(Hw x, Hw y)//按分数从大到小排序
{
	if(x.score == y.score)
	{
		return x.time < y.time;
	}
	return x.score > y.score;
}
int main()
{
	int t;
	scanf("%d", &t);
	while(t--)
	{
		int n, maxt = 0, sum = 0;
		scanf("%d", &n);
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		{
			scanf("%d", &a[i].time);
			maxt = max(maxt, a[i].time);
		}
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		{
			scanf("%d", &a[i].score);
			sum += a[i].score;
		}
		sort(a, a+n, cmp);
		int lost = 0;
		memset(used, false, sizeof(used));
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		{
			int j = a[i].time;
			for(; j > 0; j--)
			{
				if(!used[j])
				{
					used[j] = true;
					break;
				}
			}
			if(j == 0)//所有时间都安排给分数高的那门作业，则这门作业完不成了
			{
				lost += a[i].score;
			}
		}
		printf("%d\n", lost);
	}
	return 0;
}
```
